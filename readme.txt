Use this light-weight eCommerce plugin to sell your software and other digital products.

== Description ==
[Hubaga](https://hubaga.com) was built to make it easy to sell digital products without using bloated plugins. 

It uses a single-field checkout to keep the checkout process short. In addition; you can enable instacheck and load the checkout form via ajax further speeding up the checkout process.

Hubaga maximizes conversions by applying several checkout optimisation techniques such as  short checkout processes and strategic application of trust seals.
